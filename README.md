## HyperBeta

HyperBeta is a tool for the automatic identification and visualization of beta-structures in molecular dynamics files produced using the MARTINI force field. 
HyperBeta explots graph theory to identify the beta sheets, and was specifically designed to investigate the emergence of regular structures and patterns in self-assembly polypeptides.

# Usage

- Open HyperBeta's GUI by launching the gui.py script. 
- Specify the number of aminoacids in the peptides
- Open the GROMACS file containing the molecular dynamics
- Launch the analysis on the GROMACS file
- Run Hyperbeta's Visualization Tool (HVT)
